## How To Use
You need an injector to be able to use it.  
Personally I prefer [ProcessHacker 2](https://sourceforge.net/projects/processhacker/files/processhacker2/processhacker-2.39-setup.exe/download).

1. Build or download the `RiskCheat.dll`.  
2. Start Risk.  
3. Start ProcessHacker.  
4. In ProcessHacker, search for `Risk.exe`.  
5. Right-click `Risk.exe`, then choose **Miscellaneous** → **Inject DLL**.  
6. Choose `RiskCheat.dll`.  
7. Have fun!
