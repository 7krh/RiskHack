# RiskHack

RiskHack is a starter repository for research / educational tooling around the game **Risk: Global Domination**.  
This README is an initial scaffold — meant to document the project and grow as you add code and features.

> ⚠️ **Important — For ethical use only.**  
> Use RiskHack only in controlled environments (your own accounts, private servers, or with explicit permission). Do **not** use this project to cheat in online games, circumvent anti-cheat mechanisms, infringe terms of service, or harm other users. The authors are not responsible for misuse.

Tested on: **(fill in the game client versions / OS builds you actually test against)** :warning:

**Note:** This is the initial README. We'll expand sections (features, params, build steps, troubleshooting, examples) as the project grows.

## What is RiskHack?

RiskHack is a research/educational toolbox scaffold for exploring and demonstrating safe, offline interactions with the Risk: Global Domination client for learning, debugging, and instrumentation purposes. The repository currently holds starter code, build scripts, and documentation placeholders to help you iterate safely.

**Ethical use cases (examples):**
- Instrumenting a local test client to learn how the game logic works.
- Building debugging helpers that run only on a local test environment.
- Prototyping visualizations of game state from logs or exported data.
- Replaying captured network logs for offline analysis.

## Quick notes

- **This repository does NOT include or promote tools to bypass anti-cheat or gain unfair advantage in online matches.**  
- **Always test on private/local copies of the game or explicitly permitted test environments.**
- Keep sensitive data (API keys, account credentials, live server IPs) out of the repo.

## Parameters (starter CLI)

These are example command-line flags to be implemented as the codebase grows. They are **placeholders** — implement only ethical features.
